# Personal Blink Fonts
I use Blink terminal for ipad, but I want my weird fonts to be available to it.

## How to Use This
Enter Blinky's config menu and add this url to it.

`imcgaunn.github.io/blinky-fonts/css/fonts.css`

## Adding New Fonts
More fonts can be added! See the example in the `gh-pages`
branch for how this can be done.
